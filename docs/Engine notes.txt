Game State notes

What does the game state object look like?  What domain does it model?

 - A collection of game objects such as
   - Towers
   - Player Territories

- Location-oriented data

How does the game engine operate?

 - requests are added to a queue

 - engine runs as a worker thread, processing rules once per "frame"
  - if queue is empty, engine doesn't need to send a packet to users
  - consider using Dynamic Programming to lessen load of rules processing:
     hold intermediate computations in-memory between frames
     (Dynamic Programming is the worst name ever)
